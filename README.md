# Yet another simple example #2 (YASE #2)

Simple project to try out Angular Elements.

Context:

- Two components loaded as custome HTML elements
- in elements/index.html use both of them
- build as simple as possible the output (pair js + css) with build script
- have styling applied from global / shared / encapsulated scopes
